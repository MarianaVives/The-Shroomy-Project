    <h1>The Shroomy Project</h1>

    <h2>Every civilization on Earth has found some explanations to its [fungi] existence, while lending these potential friends or foes its due respect.</h2>
    
    <p> 
        For millenia, fungi- or more specifically mushrooms- have been an enigma to humans. <br>
        These organisms mysteriously grow out of the ground but unlike plants, they cannot grow their own source of food via the sun.  <br>
        Unlike animals, they cannot move. And as a matter of fact, just very few people ever thought of mushroom as alive organisms. <br>
        However, early pioneers in Botanics observed the nature of these organisms and mistakenly classified fungi within the plant kingdom. <br>
        It was until very recently, in 1968, that these peculiar organisms got awarded their own indpendent lineage: "The fungi kingdom". <br>
        Please, join this project to help widspread information regarding this resilient kingdom that has so much to offer to humanity. <br>
